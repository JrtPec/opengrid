# Example configuration file for opengrid
#
# You can put a configuration file in the opengrid library
# directory, in the 'current' directory and/or pass it to the 
# constructor of the Config class. The latter always takes
# presedence over the former.
#
# You will need to configure at least the two passwords below.
#
# Another interesting configuration property to change is
# the path of the stored data (defaults to ~/.opengrid/data)
# [data]
# folder: /path/to/opengrid/data
